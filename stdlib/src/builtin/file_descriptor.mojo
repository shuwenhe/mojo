"""Higher level abstraction for file stream.

These are Mojo built-ins, so you don't need to import them.

For example, here's how to print to a file

```mojo
var f = open("my_file.txt", "r")
print("hello", file=f)
f.close()
```

"""


@value
struct FileDescriptor:
    """File descriptor of a file."""

    var value: Int
    """The underlying value of the file descriptor."""

    fn __init__(inout self):
        """Default constructor to stdout."""
        self.value = 1

    fn __init__(inout self, x: Int):
        """Constructs the file descriptor from an integer.

        Args:
            x: The integer.
        """
        self.value = x

        """Constructs the file descriptor from a file handle.

        Args:
            f: The file handle.
